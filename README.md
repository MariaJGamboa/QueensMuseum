# Queens Museum 
Group project for the Information Modeling and Web Technologies 2024/25 course.

The Queen Museum is a companion app for a visit to an exhibition which helps the visitor visualize the items contained in an hypothetical physical museum. The development of the application is based on Multimedia Museum Meta Mirror. As specified in the requirements, the Queen Museum app offers a virtual visit of items whose history is connected to the lives of three monarchs and one princess of the United Kingdom.
